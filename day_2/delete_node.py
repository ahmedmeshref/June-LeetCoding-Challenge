"""
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
Example 2:

Note:
The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.
